# StepByStepCheck

This main folder contains all the necessary tests to thoroughly validate each of the classes used for the solid simulation of the filament. 

The subfolders refer to each class and may contain duplicates of classes to satisfy dependencies. There is a main file handling the test and possibly a few more test cases in separate files that are commented out.
